Understanding Search Algorithms
Linear Search:
A basic method where each element in the list is checked sequentially until the desired element is found or the end of the list is reached. The worst-case time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements.

Binary Search:
An efficient method used for sorted lists. It works by repeatedly dividing the list in half to find the target element. The worst-case time complexity is O(log n).

Analysis
Time Complexity Comparison:

Linear Search: O(n)
Binary Search: O(log n)
Use Cases:

Linear Search:

Best suited for small or unsorted datasets.
Easy to implement as it does not require sorting overhead.
Binary Search:

Ideal for large, sorted datasets due to its efficiency.
Requires the list to be sorted, making it suitable for situations where sorting is feasible and frequent searches are performed.
